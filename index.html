      <h1>About Me</h1>
    </header>
    <p>My name is Andy Malik. I'm <span class="age"></span> years old. I have been coding since the summer of 2007, on and off as a hobby. I started coding with CSS before I even knew what I was doing. There was a web app that hosted small pre-built websites on subdomains, with the exact same pre-made HTML and no Javascript on each of them. This essential web-host wasn't actually for making a fun website, as it had a completely different purpose, but it's where I started learning. As a user of one of these small websites, we were not allowed to edit the HTML, but we were given access to the CSS.</p>
    <p>So I opened the page, saw a bunch of code, and was really confused. Thus, I looked it up. I learned more about what CSS is and how I can manipulate it, and by trial and error, I learned CSS selectors. Like using the pound symbol for ID or period for class. I educated myself into making a vertical nav-bar from a horizontal one, and making certain elements transparent or glow on hover. I spent alot of time learning CSS without ever knowing HTML.</p>
    <p>Also, I signed up to the forums at the start of that summer, and by the end of the summer, the admin of the main web-host collective (keep in mind, it was very small community) promoted me to Vice-Admin. When I was 13 years old. The Vice-Admin had all the powers of the Global Moderator on the forums (And I was using my power honestly- I worked my way up the chain!) but I also had access to look at, but not edit, some of the files on the actual main website. Brandon, the admin, knew I was interested in learning code, and he was learning PhP and MySQL, so I asked if I could spy in on what he was doing just to see if I can understand the code. Well, it worked, and I learned PhP before HTML.</p>
    <p>I told my dad about what I was doing during the summer, and he was proud of me. He's been a coding geek his whole life, so when he discovered my excitement on the topic, he was subtly thrilled. He looked around the district and found a new Tech High-School. He signed me up, and we were given computers by the school itself. For my freshman and sophomore year, everything I did was on the computer. But... I wasn't building websites. It was just Word Docs and Powerpoint and things like that. So throughout the school year, I would go to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">w3schools.com</a> and teach myself something new each day.</p>
    <p>I started from the bottom, the HTML, and applied the knowledge of CSS I had from the summer to help identify parts of the HTML. Then I went to the CSS, and already knew most of what the website had to teach me. I was able to quickly jump to the Javascript. Then I got excited. Everything was new! I could make functions and calculate numbers and I could edit a text box or make something on the screen move when you pressed a button. I instantly wanted to make a game. I was thinking about making some Astroids-like game, but I got frustrated because the animations were flickering and shaking. I decided to make a text-based game instead, so I could only worry about the Javascript directly. CSS and HTML were simple. I wanted to work with the Javascript.</p>
    <p>So I did. I said, "I want a player in the game." And I wanted to go all out. The player was to be as indepth as a DnD character. I wanted dozens of stats that would have many effects, EXP and a level system, I wanted it all. So, I had no clue where to start. Should I make a bunch of variables? For each player AND enemy AND non-playable characters? I could store each character in an array... But then my dad said, "Use objects." And that's how I started learning Object Oriented Programming. Just to keep track of time, This was nearing the end of the 2007 - 2008 school year. I had alot of homework and tests left, so I started working on the game the day school ended. The summer of 2008. I never even seen the coding world a year before.</p>
    <p>So I delved more into Object Oriented Programming, and the use of objects. I was utterly confused on the difference between an object and an array. What's the purpose? Why don't I just use <span class="code">Player[0]='name';</span> or something like that? My dad listed an assortment of different reasons why I should use Objects over Arrays, but the one simple reason that stuck with me is to essentially, title the variables. For example, instead of <span class="code">Player[0]='name';</span> - I would use: <span class="code">Player.name='Andy'</span>. So I used objects for many things. An array of arrays of objects. The words started to click in my mind. I then got into the actual programming.</p>
    <p>Creating dozens of functions that would display something on the textarea based on what the user typed. I spent the whole summer cracking at the code and debugging the code. I would open up the index.html file directly and see how the javascript worked. Every time I added in a peice of code, I made sure it functioned properly. By the end of the summer, <a href="http://andymalik.com/trapped/1.0/">Trapped!</a> was finished. It was a hefty project, and I could not have completed it without my dad. Thanks Dad!</p>
    <p>For 10th grade, I made three more websites for school work. The Javascript always featured something new, and interesting, like eyes that follow the cursor, or changing the text on a webpage without external linking. Much toned down version of my Trapped game. But then I entered 11th grade, where the only thing I got was a Web Development class. "Cool," I thought to myself. "I'll be able to learn directly from a teacher." Well, apparently I knew more about HTML, CSS and Javascript than my instructor. Luckily, the class wasn't all about the web. The second semester was about Design, and drawing the images with photoshop, creating animated gifs, and even working with Flash animations too. It wasn't a complete bummer! Then, lastly... Senior year. I didn't code at all in my senior year.</p>
    <p>I went to Running Start, found a bunch of people who play Magic: The Gathering, and got addicted. I didn't do much of coding. Infact, I spent two and a half years in community college wanting to become a Casino Manager. But I just couldn't stick with the boring homework from Business class to Accounting, and the worst of it all, Calculus. Goodness gracious I just could not get all of that stuff down. I took a break from college with my parents supporting me the whole way through. My dad said, "If you can't get through college, let's get you a job." And we looked around a little bit until he suggested that I work with code. I mean, I knew alot about making a decent website. We stifled through the internet, and while looking for a job, we found <a href="https://www.codefellows.org">Code Fellows</a>.</p>
    <p>That's where I am at as of now. I'm undergoing the amazing teachings of Code Fellows to greatly improve my coding skills and to put my name out there. Right now, the only thing I'm really worried about is forgetting to update this page when I graduate!</p>
